## Introduction to MDX

[`mdx`](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

[`rehype-pretty-code`](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code) is a Rehype plugin powered by the
[`shiki`](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) syntax highlighter that provides beautiful code blocks for Markdown or MDX. It works on both the server at build-time (avoiding runtime syntax highlighting) and on the client for dynamic highlighting.

## Editor-Grade Highlighting

Enjoy the accuracy and granularity of VS Code's syntax highlighting engine and
the popularity of its themes ecosystem â€” use any VS Code theme you want!

## Line Numbers and Line Highlighting

Draw attention to a particular line of code.

```js {4} showLineNumbers
import { useState } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState();

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count++)}>increment count</button>
    </>
  );
}
```
